# Foreign Exchange

The main purpose of this project is to convert an amount of money with exchange rates.

This project was build with React & SASS.

The application is made only of functionnal components and hooks.

The transition between views was made with [react-transition-group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/).

The exchange rates came from [open exchange rates](https://openexchangerates.org/) API.

The idea behind this project was to explore/practice/show the use of an external API, fetch API, HTML form and transitions between views/states.
